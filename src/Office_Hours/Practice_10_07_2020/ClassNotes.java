Practice Topics: Collection:
							List Interface
							Set Interface
							Iterable Interface


Package name: Practice_10_07_2020


Collection: Interface, extended by List, Set, Queue

List vs Set: size is dynamic, only supports Objects

	List: accepts duplicated objects, has index number, size is dynamic

		ArrayList: Array Based
					retriving object is faster ( get() )

		LinkedList: doublly linked (fastest)
					add & remove functions are faster ( add(), addAll(), remove(), removeAll(), retainAll(), removeIf() )

		Vector: is synchronized
				advantage: Thread-safe

		Stack: is synchronized
				pop(): Last in first out order


	Set: does not accepts duplicated objects, does not have index number, size is dynamic

		HashSet: changes the insertion order (order is random)
					accepts null

		LinkedHashSet: does not change the insertion order


		TreeSet: implemnts SortedSet interface, sorts the objects in ascending order
					does not accept null



synchronized :  Thread-safe
		advantage: Thread-safe
		disadvantage: slow

Thread: process of scheduling the object by the operating system

Thread-safety: in multiple threads, each thread gets executed one at a time



Iterable(I): allows us to access objects in collection type, also allows us to remove them

		if a class has IS A relation with Iterable, then we can apply Iterator (I)

		iterator(): return Iterator (I) after iterating the objects of the Collection

		hasNext(): checks if there is object can be iterated and accessible, return boolean

		next(): access to the obejct and returns it if hasNext() is true

		remove(): removes the correcnt objects that's accessed from collection
