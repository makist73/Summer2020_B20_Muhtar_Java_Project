Package name: Practice_10_07_2020


Collection: Interface, extended by List, Set, Queue

List vs Set: size is dynamic, only supports Objects

	List: accepts duplicated objects, has index number, size is dynamic

		ArrayList: Array Based
					retriving object is faster ( get() )

		LinkedList: doublly linked (fastest)
					add & remove functions are faster ( add(), addAll(), remove(), removeAll(), retainAll(), removeIf() )

		Vector: is synchronized
				advantage: Thread-safe

		Stack: is synchronized
				pop(): Last in first out order


	Set: does not accepts duplicated objects, does not have index number, size is dynamic



synchronized :  Thread-safe
		advantage: Thread-safe
		disadvantage: slow

Thread: process of scheduling the object by the operating system

Thread-safety: in multiple threads, each thread gets executed one at a time
