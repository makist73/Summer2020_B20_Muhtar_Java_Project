Topic: Custom methods Continue:


Package name: day31_Recap

warmup tasks:
	1.  write a return method called frequency that accepts two parameters: string str and char ch, the method returns the frequency of the ch from the str as an int
			Ex:
				frequency("AAA", 'A') ==>  3
				frequency("ABAB", 'B') ==> 2

			Note: MUST use Arrays and for each loop

			please copy paste the method to the util class

	2. use the above method to create another called uniques that accepts a string paramter and returns it's unique characters as String

			Ex:
				uniques("ABBC");       ==> "AC"
				uniques("Cybertek");   ==> "cybrtk"

				please copy paste the method to the util class

	3. use the methods removeDup and frequency in util class to create a thrid method called frequencyOfChars that can find the frequency of all characters from a string
		Ex:
			frequencyOfChars("AAABBBBCCCC");  ===> A3B4C4
			frequencyOfChars("DDEFJJJ"); ===> D2E1F1J3


			"AABBBCCC"  ==> A2B3C3

			remove duplicates ==> A B C
			frequency ==>         2 3 3

			A2B3C3

			FrequencyOfCharacters


methods: grouping a series of code fragments to create a function

		Access-Modifier  Specifier  Return-type  MethodName(Parameter){

				Statements

		}


		Access-Modifier: public, protected, default, private
				public: always accessible

		Specifiers: static, final, abstract, synchronized
				static: can be called through class name

				Arrays.sort

		Return-Type (mandatory): void, DataType
				void: does not return any value
				DataType: MUST return a value


		Parameter: necessary info
				when method is called, it's mandatory to pass argument(s)



Reveiw:
	Array: day 24 & 27

	nested loop: day 22 & 23

	for & while: day 18 & 20

	String: day 15, 16

	if & switch: day 9 , 10, 11


	problem solving:
				1. watch tthre recordings of warmup tasks

				2. Office Hour
